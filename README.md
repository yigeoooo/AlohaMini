AlohaMini is a dual-arm mobile robot with a motorized vertical lift — beautifully designed, fully 3D-printable, and affordable.  

Built for embodied AI research and real-world manipulation. Assemble at home in ~60 minutes, customize every part, and train or deploy with LeRobot.

Note:
Use ROS only if you need URDF visualization, RViz inspection, or Gazebo simulation.


## Updates

- [2026-02-26] Update the fine-tuning and deployment guide for Pi 0.5 on Alohamini ('examples/pi0.5_openpi')
- [2025-12-18] — URDF and simulation assets are now available for visualization and simulation (`simulation/src/Aloha/`)
- [2025-11-27] STEP (CAD) files are now available (`/hardware/mobile_base/step/`)


### What Makes It Different

- **Motorized vertical lift** — 0–60 cm travel (floor-to-table reach)
- **5-camera perception system** — top, front, back, and dual arm cameras engineered for embodied-AI reproducibility
- **Completely open-source** — hardware and software freely available
- **LeRobot-compatible** — works out of the box
- **Clean, modern design** — built for both function and aesthetics
- **Low-cost & accessible** — engineered so anyone can build a capable robot at home

Note: 
- Printable STL files under `/hardware/`
- Compute platform can be replaced with Jetson Nano or similar SBCs if desired.
- URDF files will be released soon

## Quick Start

Start building and running AlohaMini:

1. **Hardware acquisition** — Purchase components and 3D print parts  
   See **[BOM & 3D-Print](docs/BOM.md)**

1. **Assembly** — build the robot in ~60 minutes (SO-ARM pre-assembled)  
   See **[assembly guide](docs/hardware_assembly.md)**

1. **Software setup & teleoperation** — install, connect, and control the robot  
   See **[software guide](software)**





##  Product Line
| Model | Build | Rigidity | Target Users | Official Store (US) | Official Store (CN) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AlohaMini** | Fully 3D-printed | Standard | Education, makers, research labs, home builds | - | [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?abbucket=9&id=1015799132286) |
| **AlohaMini Pro** | Hybrid **3D-print + metal** | **~3×–5× stiffer** | Researchers needing plug-and-play, stable hardware | - | [taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?abbucket=9&id=1015799132286) |

> Same URDF & control stack across both versions — only structural materials differ.  
> Official store links are optional purchase channels for complete robots / kits.  
> AlohaMini remains open-source and can be self-built from the BOM, 3D-print files, and assembly docs.
